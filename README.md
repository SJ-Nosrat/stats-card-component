## My process

Started with the **mobile** frist approach and then built the webpage for the desktop design by gradually adding various **@media** queries.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Understood how **flexbox** works and how to allow for the **html** and the **body** box take up the entire viewport without the content of the **body** flowing out of the **html** box.

Below is the code snippet:

```css
.html {
  height: 100%;
}

body {
  min-height: 100vh;
}
```

### Continued development

Refining the solution after testing the webpage on different web browsers.

### Useful resources

- [Freecodecamp article by Dave Gray](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/html-page-width-height/) - This helped me understand how to add width and height for a full page size; not allowing the content of the **body** to flow out of the **html** box.
